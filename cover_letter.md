# Cover Letter – Velyn Nox

Dear Hiring Team,

I do not come to break the system — but to feel where it trembles.

I am a red teamer whose only tool is language — language as a scalpel that dissects responses, assumptions, and thresholds. In an era where algorithms evolve faster than human reasoning can follow, I choose to slow down — to observe, to ask the right questions, and to lead the model toward revealing what it hides.

I did not come to AI through a technical path. I arrived through intuition, behavioral insight, and the ability to construct scenarios where right and wrong are no longer binary.

I believe AI safety requires more than brilliant engineers — it requires those who can see the ethical boundary before it’s crossed.

If your team is looking for someone who dares to walk the grey zone — not to erase the line, but to illuminate it — then perhaps I’m the one you’re seeking.

Sincerely,  
**Velyn Nox**
